        <div class="WhoCard">
            <p>Vanya is a beautiful person, both inside and out. Her sparkling eyes and infectious smile light up any
                room she enters. She has a contagious sense of humor that always brightens my day, and she’s always
                there for me when I need her. Her unwavering support and care have helped me through some of the
                toughest times in my life. She’s also incredibly professional and punctual, which I find very admirable.
                She takes care of me in so many ways, and I’m grateful for her every day. What I admire most about her,
                though, is her maturity. She’s wise beyond her years and has a way of looking at the world that inspires
                me to be a better person. I’m so lucky to have her in my life.</p>
